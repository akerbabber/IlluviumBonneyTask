# ERC20 Recoverable Token

The ERC20 Recoverable Token is a Solidity smart contract that extends the standard ERC20 token functionalities. It allows users to set a backup address and provides an emergency token recovery mechanism in case of lost private keys or compromised accounts. The contract also implements a blacklist mechanism to prevent transfers to compromised accounts.
